## Narrative

Sarah, a computer science student, opens her terminal to work on calculus homework. Instead of the usual stark command prompt, she's welcomed by math_cli's colorful banner and a friendly "Ready to solve some problems?" message. As she types "integrate(x^2, 0, 5)", the function name highlights in blue and a helpful tooltip shows the expected parameters.

When she presses Enter, a brief spinning animation appears with "Calculating..." and within seconds, the result appears in bright green with proper mathematical formatting. A small checkmark animation celebrates her successful calculation, making the experience feel rewarding rather than mechanical.

Later, when she makes a syntax error, instead of a cryptic error message, math_cli gently underlines the problematic section and suggests "Did you mean 'sqrt' instead of 'sqr'?" with a simple key press to accept the correction. The interactive history lets her quickly review her previous work, with each calculation clearly formatted and timestamped.

By the end of her study session, Sarah has completed her homework efficiently and actually enjoyed the process. She shares a screenshot of math_cli's colorful output with her study group, leading three more students to download and start using the tool. The delightful experience transformed a utilitarian task into an engaging interaction, increasing both user satisfaction and organic growth.
